# Mind Garden ðŸŒ³
## Private, whimsical, decentralized note-taking

I like Notion but I don't like their privacy policy. 

I needed a note-taking app that would be fun enough to replace Notion, but more private than Notion.

I want to make it clear that the point of Mind Garden is to make it fun to live inside your computer. I live inside my computer, so I want to use a note taking app that respects my privacy while also being fun. We spend all our time online these days so let us spend the time with glee.
