# Mind Garden ðŸŒ³
## Private, whimsical, decentralized note-taking

I like Notion but I don't like their privacy policy. 

I needed a note-taking app that would be fun enough to replace Notion, but more private than Notion.

I want to make it clear that the point of Mind Garden is to make it fun to live inside your computer. I live inside my computer, so I want to use a note taking app that respects my privacy while also being fun. We spend all our time online these days so let us spend the time with glee.

## Issues 

I am not a node expert. I figured out how to save files but not how to then view the files saved. [Please help me.](https://github.com/digitalgardening/mindgarden/blob/main/load/server.js)

This is an excerpt from `load/server.js` which exhibits my inability to finish this project essentially:

```
const onrequest = require("hyperdrive-http"); // I think mafintosh wrote this in the tests fot hyperdrive-http but I butchered it

// later on...after all the imports

app.get("/browse", function (req, res) {

drive.ready(function (err) {

if (err) throw err;

console.log("whee âœµ " + drive.key.toString("hex"));

onrequest(drive); //this doesn't work. I don't know what I did

});

});

```
